#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
This dataset collects information from over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil with the focus on whether or not patients show up for their appointments. A number of characteristics about each patient are included in each row. Bolsa Familia is a social welfare program in Brazil that provides financial aid to families in need of assistance. I chose to explore why patients may or may not show up for their appointment and factors influencing their decision and ability in doing so.
